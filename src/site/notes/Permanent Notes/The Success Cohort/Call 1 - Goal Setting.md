# Call 1 - Goal Setting

### Notes

- Goals are important, they help you focus and keep on track 
- Goals are meant to be aspirational  
- Internal vs External drive is important to understand 
	- We focus a lot on external, but hardly on internal
	- Internal Gratification Model vs External
	- Focus on internal changes
- Ask yourself Why 
- Outcome = What you know + Who you are
