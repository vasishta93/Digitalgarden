I have a passion for reading and it plays a significant role in both my learning and leisure activities. In 2022, I exceeded my goal of reading over 20 books (including both new and old titles) and this year, I aim to read 50 books. My reading list is diverse and includes fiction, non-fiction, self-help, and poetry. I also enjoy rereading books that I've read in the past. 

Below is the ongoing list of books for 2023, i have added some and will continue to add all the books i am reading/will be reading here along with notes on some books.
