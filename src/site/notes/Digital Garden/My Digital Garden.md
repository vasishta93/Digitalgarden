# Welcome to My Digital Garden 

A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "_should be_.” It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined. 

## Whats it not?

**Its Not my Blog - Thats on [My Metaverse](https://metaverse.vasishtachary.com/) 
Its not my Personal Notebook** 

This is a space for my thoughts, learnings, education and more, just dumped in the most true and raw format. Here is where you might find my half complete notes from my digital classes, half complete notes from books, my BIP content around productivity, community and more. Its not protected by any password, paywall or even login. Its for everyone to see, use when needed and learn.
